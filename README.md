## Why?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least one-third of U.S. residents do not get enough sleep on a regular basis. Restlessness and the inability to sleep are nothing foreign to many students and adults. Technology can cause insomnia, but it doesn't have to be the case.

## How?
Doz focuses on both visual and auditory faculties to help its user fall asleep.

The app's library of graphics and sounds all promote calming behavior. The graphics are repetitive and soothing, meant to relieve anxiety as well as tired out the eyes. Simple, visual breathing exercises are also included. These require minimal thought, but have significant impact on the body. The provided sounds are also repetitive and drowning -- not overwhelming, but entrancing.

Research suggests cooler colors and blue hues are conducive to sleep, as they have an innate psychological significance to humans. Humans naturally associate cooler lighting to night-time, while warmer lighting suggests morning and day.
